    "## Interacting with the simulation (real robot)\n",

    "### Moving the real robot\n",
    "Up to now, you only moved the robot in the MoveIt application. This is very useful because you can do many tests without worrying about any damage. However, the final goal will always be to move the real robot, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "The MoveIt package you've created is able to provide the necessary ROS services and actions in order to plan and execute trajectories, but it isn't able to pass these trajectories to the real robot. All the kinematics you've been performing were executed in an internal simulator that MoveIt provides. In order to communicate with the real robot, it will be necessary to do a couple of modifications to the MoveIt package you created in the previous chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, in this course, you don't have a real robot to do this with, so you will apply the same, but for the moving, to the simulated robot. In order to see what you need to change in your MoveIt package, just follow the next exercise.\t\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, let's have a look at the file ros_controllers.yaml that has been created by the MoveIt Setup Assistant. If you remember, this file was configured in the Setup ROS Controllers section from the previous chapter. You will find this file inside the config folder.\n",
